## UET-VNU Advanced Programming Course Big Assignment

## Kmeans Algorithm Visualization and Application
### For more information, please visit:

- [Vietnamese Kmeans Algorithm Explained](https://machinelearningcoban.com/2017/01/01/kmeans/)

This is a visualization of Kmeans algorithm. Help people to understand the algorithm and apply it to their own data.

Just my first time to use kmeans algorithm and apply it to compress images. I hope it will be useful for you.

### For Python version, you can check out the code:
